Wrote scripts and leveraged low code solutions to automate manual processes.

What I worked on:

- Developed a C# script that automated a legacy, manual report generation process
- Used Power Automate to automate a ton of tedius Excel formatting for those reports
- These two automations saved around 50+ hours per year
