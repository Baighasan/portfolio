During my time back at Ingine Consultants I got exposed to a lot of Platform Engineering and Security concepts. I built the infrastructure for a data pipeline moving PII data, all while ensuring 100% compliance with data regulations.

Here's some stuff I did:

- Integrated Snyk security scanning and Docker image validation into the GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline, which was done with the goal of strengthening our Zero Trust posture
- Provisioned GDPR-compliant Azure infrastructure with Terraform, which supported systems that handled 500+ PII files per week
- Built an event-driven Azure Functions API with Python FastAPI that audited data integrity and exposed 4 critical staging issues before the data reached downstream analytics teams
