At Toyota I primarily worked on software that orchestrates AGV traffic. AGVs are autonomous vehicles that transport materials across plants. This software is used in 10 Toyota plants across North America.

Some things I did were:

- Built a configurable heatmap dashboard for AGV faults that helped plant engineers identify fault trends
- Containerized services that consumed MQTT-streamed data from AGVs
- Investigated bugs slipping into production and discovered root cause was features skipping testing. Implemented Zephyr test management into Jira, set up testing workflows, and presented problem and solution to upper management, gaining approval
